# SimGUI

TODO: add a description of the java application

## Building

This project uses gradle to build and run the application. To run the application, run `./gradlew run`. To build the application JAR, run `./gradlew build`. The JAR will be created in `build/libs/simgui.jar`.

If you don't want to use the command line to run the application every time, import this project into your favorite Gradle-compatible Java IDE, and create a run configuration for the gradle `run` task.
